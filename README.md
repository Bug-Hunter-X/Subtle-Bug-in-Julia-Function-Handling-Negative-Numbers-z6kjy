This repository contains a simple Julia function with a subtle bug. The function is intended to square the input number if positive, return 0 if the input is 0, and return the negative of the squared input number if the input is negative. However, it currently does not behave correctly for negative inputs. The bug and its solution are demonstrated through code examples. The `bug.jl` file shows the buggy code, and `bugSolution.jl` demonstrates the corrected version.
